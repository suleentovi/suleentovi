I am a Data Analyst Professional, with a background in healtcare as a Registered Nurse. Also, who is goal-driven to expand insight in healthcare data. Therefore, with the experience in progamming languages, more efficient patient-centered care can be provided through machine learning algorithms through data science within healthcare.


Some programming languages I enjoy working with include Tableau, PowerBi, SQL, and Python!
